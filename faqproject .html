                    Yes! Ordering a home inspection before listing a house can be a smart and strategic move that can benefit the seller in the long run.

Explain to the seller that a home inspection provides you with important information about the condition of your home and any potential issues that need to be addressed. It’s always better to be proactive and consider getting ahead of any critical repairs or maintenance items before putting your house on the market. There are some downsides to keep in mind, such as the cost (average cost of a home inspection is $341 in the U.S.) and the fact that you may be legally required to disclose major problems to would-be buyers. However, getting a home inspection helps ensure that your house is in top condition and that you’re not surprised by what may need to be fixed or repaired down the line.

        <!-- Question 3 -->
        <div class="card">
            <div class="card-header" id="headingThree">
                <h2 class="mb-0">

                        What are my options if my offer is turned down?

                <div class="card-body">
                    Let your buyer know that if an offer for a house is turned down, you have several options:

Boost your offer: If the seller rejected your offer because they believe it is too low, you may consider increasing your offer.
Ask for a counteroffer: The seller may not want to accept your offer but may be willing to negotiate by providing a counteroffer. This gives you an opportunity to revise your offer or negotiate other terms, such as closing date or repairs.
Keep searching: If the seller is not willing to negotiate and you cannot or don’t want to increase your offer, you can move on and continue your search for another property.
